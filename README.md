This project examines the optimisation of the location of social facilities in the context of the 15-minute city concept, focusing on the city of Salzburg. The '15-minute city' concept proposes that basic services - such as healthcare, education, grocery stores and recreational facilities - should be accessible within a 15-minute walk or bike ride from residents' homes. The efficient distribution of these services significantly improves urban quality of life, reduces socio-economic disparities, fosters community connections and supports environmental sustainability by minimising reliance on road transport.
Salzburg presents unique challenges due to its historic centre, diverse geographical landscape and significant natural barriers including the mountains and the Salzach River. These characteristics complicate equal access to social services, with stark contrasts between the densely populated central areas and the newly developed peripheral neighbourhoods.
This study answers the key question: How can social infrastructure be optimally allocated to meet the dynamic needs of the population, ensuring maximum accessibility and efficiency? Well-established algorithmic approaches are critically analyzed, with an emphasis on Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) due to its precision in accounting for complex urban constraints. Data collected from OpenStreetMap, municipal demographic sources and detailed GIS analyses form the basis of a robust methodological approach.
The project identified significant disparities in the availability of services, such as pharmacies, highlighting areas of severe undersupply, particularly in peripheral neighborhoods. With the help of the IIP, the project proposes strategic locations for the siting of facilities to effectively address these disparities. This optimised approach significantly reduces travel distances, encourages active mobility (walking and cycling) and aligns urban infrastructure more closely with Salzburg's evolving demographic and geographic realities.
Ultimately, the project connects theoretical optimization methods with practical urban planning by proposing concrete solutions to increase urban equity, sustainability and resilience in Salzburg.
