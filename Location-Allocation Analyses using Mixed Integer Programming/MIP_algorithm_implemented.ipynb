    "### Purpose of the Code:\n",
    "#### The goal of the code is to optimize the location of drugstores (Drogerien) in the city of Salzburg so that every residential building is assigned to one nearby store (within walking distance of 1500 meters), while minimizing the number of newly opened stores. The model is implemented using Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) and solved using Python (with PuLP).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Each building must be assigned to exactly one drugstore.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A building can only be assigned to an open (selected) drugstore.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Maximum walking distance is 1500 meters between building and store.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Limit on the number of drugstores per district:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Usually max 4 per district, but up to 5 in \"Leopoldskron/Moos\" due to low density and long distances.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. For districts with existing drugstores, the model only optimizes for unserved buildings, using only new locations and adjusting the limit accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. If too many drugstores are selected, the model automatically keeps the ones that serve the most buildings within the 1500 m range.\n"
